Description: Terminal-based emacs-like editor from the 1980's 
  EmACT is a GNU GPL implementation initially adapted to the 
  writing of the programs of the Le-Lisp system from INRIA on 
  PC. It has the advantage of being not very greedy for memory 
  capacity and to be easily portable to various machines.
