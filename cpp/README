                           THE HISTORY OF EMACT


This   product   is  an  original  development  made  to  provide  an
emacs-like  editor  on  the  PC  for the purpose of writing Lisp code
with  the  same features found on other Lisp development systems.  In
1985,  with about 512 Ko of memory,  it was obvious that Gosling, GNU
or  other  emacs written in Lisp were too big to run on M$-DOG.  So I
decided  to  write my own editor that closely works like those I used
on VAX Unix at that time. I started with Conroy's MicroEMACS.

After a great amount of time,  made essentially after hours, EmACT is
now  a  pretty good clone of GNU Emacs.  It has all the features that
programmers enjoy,  like parentheses matching,  auto-indent for Lisp,
C,  C++,  compile mode, tags and even a Lisp interpreter which is not
however  compatible  with GNU MockLisp.  It can be ported to all UN*X
systems  (terminal  and  X-Window) and it runs of course on all Intel
based  system  in  text  or  graphic  mode (MSDOS,  OS/2 Windows 3.x,
Windows NT/2000/XP/Vista and Windows 95/98/Me).

Why EmACT? In 1985 I was working for a company named ACT.

SOURCE INSTALL:
---------------

   prompt> sh ./configure	# or ./configure --prefix=$HOME
   prompt> make			# make binaries and compile lisp code
   prompt> make install		# you must have be root

If it does not work or you're not on unix like system:

- With MSVC, compile EmACT using 'nmake nt-msc' at toplevel distribution.
- Put all *.lsp in /usr/local/emact directory
  (or add EMACSLIB system variable).
- Edit emacs.lsp to match your needs.
- Read the doc for more customizations.

Latest version should be in: http://www.eligis.com/emacs
